RoadVision AI – Smart Road Complaint System

An AI-powered, citizen-centric web platform that enables users to detect road issues, raise intelligent complaints, and track repair progress digitally.

📌 Project Overview

RoadVision AI is a modern web-based system designed to improve road maintenance reporting by empowering citizens.
Using AI-assisted media analysis, the platform identifies road problems such as potholes, cracks, and waterlogging, generates official complaint letters, and predicts repair timelines.

This project bridges the gap between citizens and government authorities through transparency, automation, and smart analytics.
